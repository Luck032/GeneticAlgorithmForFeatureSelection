# Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection (Adapted Version)

This repository implements a genetic algorithm for feature selection in a classification task using a Random Forest model.

The code is **largely based on the original work by Renato Sousa**:
https://github.com/renatoosousa/GeneticAlgorithmForFeatureSelection

Only minimal adaptations were made to fit the needs of my project, while the core logic and workflow remain unchanged.

All credit for the original implementation goes to the original author.
